## Dev Notes

The codebase has been around for a few years now and it grew a bit rusty.
A few things surely could be addressed:

- Overall architecture should be simplified and refactored into a more strict feature-based one
- The single responsibility principle is broken and should be refactored in a few places like some of the Use Cases
- Retrofit could be replaced in favor of Ktor Client
- Jetpack Compose migration (although there is no **_real_** benefit of it currently from end-user point of view)
- Add more unit tests to complete the suite and increase coverage

## FAQ

**1. Can I watch/stream/download shows and movies with the Showly app?**

No, that is not possible. Showly is a progress tracking type of app - not a streaming service.

**2. I'm a user from India. I can't see any images and also encounter errors!**

There is a known issue with TMDB API being blocked by India gov.
For more details and a possible solution please see the thread here:
[https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/65d226e5c433ea0187b5b958#65d2dd5128d7fe017c34e9b5](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/65d226e5c433ea0187b5b958#65d2dd5128d7fe017c34e9b5)

**3. The Show/Episode/Movie I'm looking for seems to be missing. What can I do?**

Showly uses [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) as its main data source.
If something is missing please use "Import Show" / "Import Movie" option located at the bottom of Trakt.tv website.
It's also possible to contact Trakt.tv support about any related issue.
