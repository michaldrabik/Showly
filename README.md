## Dev Notes

The codebase has been around for a few years now and it grew a bit rusty.
Few things surely could be adressed:

- Overall architecture should be simplified and refactored into more strict feature-based one
- Single responsibility principle is broken and should be refactored in a few places like some of the Use Cases
- Retrofit could be replaced in favor of Ktor Client
- Jetpack Compose migration (although there is no **_real_** benefit of it currently from end-user point of view)
- Add more unit tests to complete suite and increase coverage

## FAQ

**1. Can I watch/stream/download shows and movies with Showly app?**

  No, that is not possible. Showly is a progress tracking type of app - not a streaming service.

**2. Show/Episode/Movie I'm looking for seems to be missing. What can I do?**

  Showly uses [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) as its main data source.
  If something is missing please use "Import Show" / "Import Movie" option located at the bottom of Trakt.tv website.
  It's also possible to contact Trakt.tv support about any related issue.
